ATM Banking Interface
Inside this repository, you'll discover a Java program that acts just like an ATM machine you'd find at a bank. This little program mimics the ATM experience using fancy programming techniques.

What Does It Do?
BankAccount Class: This is like your bank account in the digital world. It can do cool things like check how much money you have, let you put more money in, or take some out. It even keeps your secrets safe with a PIN!

ATM Class: Imagine this as the screen and buttons of the ATM. It's where you type in your secret code and choose what you want to do—like check your balance or take out some cash.

How to Use It:
BankAccount Class: Has all the tools to handle your account—putting in money, taking it out, and making sure it's secure.

ATM Class: Acts like a pretend ATM machine:

It asks you for your account number and PIN, just like a real ATM.
Then, it lets you do stuff like check how much money you have or put more in or take some out.
You can say goodbye and exit when you're done
